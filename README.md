# Unit 10 Projects
I Am Now putting all my unit 10 projects in this one Repo since having a separate one for each seems a little silly.
Each folder contains an index.html and a .js file that correlates to the lesson that I am exercising. 
Some folders also contain my notes.js which contain personal references for the related material.
